# Introduction

The initial crucial distinction lies in whether you are valuing a business as a whole or just its equity component. A business can possess significant inherent value, but if its debt burden is excessively high, the equity stake can become worthless.

**Business Valuation** focuses on the total value generated by the company's assets. While equity investors receive the residual cash flows after all other obligations are met, lenders are entitled to contractually obligated cash flows (interest and principal payments). From the business's perspective, both investors and lenders provide capital. When valuing the entire business, we consider the cash flows generated by its assets before any debt payments but after accounting for necessary reinvestments to support future growth. The appropriate discount rate for business valuation reflects the overall cost of financing the firm, considering the proportion of both debt and equity used.

**Equity Valuation**, on the other hand, specifically evaluates the cash flow available to equity holders. This is calculated as the cash flow generated by the business *after* deducting debt payments, research and development (R&D) expenses, and other operational costs. This residual cash flow is then discounted at a rate that reflects the risk associated with investing in the company's equity. Therefore, equity valuation aims to determine the value of the ownership stake in the business.

Maintaining consistency between these two approaches is paramount. Ideally, starting with the total cash flow generated by the firm, you **should** be able to derive the equity value by simply subtracting the value of the outstanding debt.

$$
V_{equity} = V_{firm} - D
\label{eq:firm-equity}
$$

What constitutes the debt that needs to be subtracted?

1.  All interest-bearing debt obligations should be subtracted. This includes loans, bonds, and other forms of debt on which the company pays interest.
2.  Accounts payable[^1], representing short-term obligations to suppliers for goods or services purchased on credit, should **not** be subtracted from the cash flow to the firm. This is because accounts payable typically do not incur interest charges and are considered part of the company's operating liabilities.

[^1]: Accounts Payable (AP) is a short-term liability on a company's balance sheet representing the money owed to its vendors or suppliers for goods or services purchased on credit.

> **Valuable Business with Zero Equity Value**

> It's possible for a company to generate substantial revenue and still have zero value for its equity holders. This scenario arises when the company carries a significant amount of debt, consuming all of its income to cover interest and principal payments. Despite the underlying business being potentially sound and generating revenue, there are no residual cash flows left for equity investors, resulting in a zero equity value.

## Cost of Capital

The previous section highlighted the distinction between valuing the entire business and valuing its equity. Fundamentally, the difference lies in the cash flows being considered. The sum of the cash flows available to both debt and equity holders is termed the *cash flow to the firm*. This represents the cash remaining after accounting for depreciation, taxes, working capital adjustments, and capital expenditures. From this cash flow, the firm must compensate both its lenders (with the Cost of Debt, $C_D$) and its equity investors (with the Cost of Equity, $C_E$). These stakeholders expect a return commensurate with the risk they undertake. The overall cost of financing the company's operations is known as the cost of capital. It can be calculated as a weighted average of the cost of equity and the after-tax cost of debt, reflecting the proportion of each in the company's capital structure.

$$
WACC = \frac{E}{E+D} \ C_E + \frac{D}{E+D} \ C_D (1-T)
$$

Where:

* $WACC$ is the Weighted Average Cost of Capital.
* $E$ is the market value of equity.
* $D$ is the market value of debt.
* $C_E$ is the cost of equity.
* $C_D$ is the cost of debt.
* $T$ is the corporate tax rate.

## Price vs. Value

Valuation is the process of determining the intrinsic worth of an asset or business. However, in the short to medium term, market prices can deviate significantly from intrinsic values. For example, if all stocks within a particular sector are overvalued due to market sentiment, a valuation based on fundamentals might not be immediately relevant for predicting short-term price movements. In such cases, investors might resort to pricing a stock relative to its peers.

It's important to recognize that not everything can be valued using traditional intrinsic valuation methods. Some assets are more appropriately priced based on market comparisons or other factors:

|             | Valuation                                                                 | Pricing                                                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Assets      | Yes, based on the present value of expected future cash flows and associated risk. | Yes, by comparing to the prices of similar assets in the market.           |
| Commodity   | Yes, theoretically based on long-term utilitarian demand and supply dynamics (though short-term price fluctuations can be significant). | Yes, by analyzing historical price trends and current market conditions. |
| Currency    | No, generally not valued intrinsically.                                    | Yes, by comparing its exchange rate against other currencies.              |
| Collectible | No, intrinsic value is difficult to determine.                             | Yes, based on factors like scarcity, desirability, historical significance, and current market demand. |
